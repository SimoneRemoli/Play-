### :lotus_position_man: This repository contains a lot of basic console application game code.
Ever since I was a child I have always **played video games**.
The problem was when I got older, because I think I was someone who immediately stopped playing video games at a very young age.
However, when I became passionate about IT, I began to think that that moment should return: well, yes, it has returned. Thanks to the programming.
This is why I always say:
**"Programming is a game."**
